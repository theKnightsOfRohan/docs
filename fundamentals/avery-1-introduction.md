# ðŸ“ª DevGPT Introduction

## What is DevGPT?

DevGPT enables autonomous code generation by turning any prompt into new code, files, and configurations. The end result? A seamless workflow that saves developers precious time and effort, acting as your own personal junior developer so you can focus on the big picture.

We're also excited to announce that we currently have an open-source iteration of DevGPT, aiming to empower and revolutionise the developer community by enhancing its capabilities.

Stay tuned for the future of efficient coding!
