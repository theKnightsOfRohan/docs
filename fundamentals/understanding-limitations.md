# ðŸ“Ž Understanding Limitations

DevGPT is a powerful tool designed to streamline developer tasks, but it does have some limitations.

### **Limitations of** DevGPT:

* Dependence on Code Generation Models: DevGPT relies on publicly available code generation models, which limits the range of code it can produce.
* Compatibility with Project Requirements: The generated code may not always meet specific project requirements or adhere to certain coding standards.
* Occasional Bugs and Technical Issues: Like any tool, DevGPT is subject to occasional bugs or technical issues that can impact its performance.
* Continuous Improvement: The community is actively working on addressing these limitations in future versions of DevGPT, an open-source evolution of the tool.
